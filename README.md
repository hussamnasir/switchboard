On demand configuration of SDN network links for SDN controllers running the Ryu REST Router

Duke OIT has begun deploying Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure for
on-demand configuration of bypass networks both on campus and between higher education institutions over Internet2. These SDN connections can provide very-high-speed paths for moving large volumes of data, and can be configured by on-the-fly Switchboardâ€”a web application developed at Duke. 

Switchboard enables real-time, self-service provisioning of high-speed network links by authorized users; this simplifies setting up both long term networks and one-time connections for data migrations.
